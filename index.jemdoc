== Short Bio
Currently working in LAMP, CVC hosted by [https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Gsw2iUEAAAAJ&hl=en Dr. Joost Van De Weijer] and [https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zdIW07oAAAAJ&hl=en Dr. Bogdan Raducanu] on problems in Continual Learning. Previously was a Post Doctoral Researcher with [https://people.iith.ac.in/vineethnb/ Prof Vineeth N Balasubramanian], IIT, Hyderabad sponsored by Microsoft Research and worked on problems on robustness of explainability methods. Obtained my PhD from CMI, Chennai guided by Prof [https://www.cmi.ac.in/~kv/ K. V. Subrahmanyam] and [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/amitdesh/ Dr. Amit Deshpande] from Microsoft Research, India. My thesis was based on problems in Adversarial Robustness of Deep Learning Models.
